Azure JS SDK wrapper f√ºr Omnis JSWorker.

Check your node environment and update to the latest version and set the environment version accordingly:

- List packages: nvm ls
- Install latest: nvm install node --latest-npm
- List current: nvm current
- Change current: nvm alias default 23.1.0 or nvm alias default node (latest)
- Use specific: nvm use 23.1.0 or nvm use node (latest)


After cloning the project, run "npm install" to install the dependencies.
Make sure you do not rename the project folder, it's name has to be: azure-doc-ai 

The project will not run as standalone JS! 
It is build to only run with omnis_calls.js and has to be deployed to the JSWorker Folder inside either the APP Path or the Install Path of Omnis.
Copy the hole project folder to either directory.

If you changed the name of the folder, you will have to update the name in the omnis demo library: method "analyzeDocument", line 21 "Do iJSW.$callmethod('azure-doc-int'...."

Before Omnis 11, any module had to be manually added to the omnis_modules.js.
Unsupported hint: Copy or deploy the new omnis_modules.js and the other .js files out of an Omnis 11 installation to the jsworker folder of previous Omnis versions to benefit from automated module and method registration.
